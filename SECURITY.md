You should receive an acknowledgement within 72 hours. We will work with you on
a coordinated disclosure and credit you in the advisory unless you prefer
anonymity.

## Threat model notes

These tools consume and forward ADS-B data, which is untrusted, broadcast
radio input. Specifically:

- All decoder output (`aircraft.json`, Beast, SBS, AVR) is treated as
  **untrusted input**: parsers must never crash, allocate unboundedly, or
  execute anything derived from the data.
- URLs, hostnames and command templates come from local configuration files,
  never from decoder output.
- The `shell`/`restart` style integrations must be explicitly enabled in
  configuration; they are off by default.
- Feeds are forwarded as opaque bytes; no TLS termination or authentication is
  implied unless explicitly documented.
